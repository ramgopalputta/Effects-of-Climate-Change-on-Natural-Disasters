# Abstract of the project: 

Climate change has created a series of adverse effects on our planet. Is it causing an effect on the frequency and severity of natural disasters across the globe? 
If so, can governments save human lives and money by reducing climate change causes? Our carbon footprint harms the environment we live in as it is one of the main 
causes of human-induced climate change. As of October 11, 2022, there have been 15 weather/climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each to affect 
the United States (Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters, 2022). This study investigates the impact of CO2 emissions on the frequency and severity of natural 
disasters and questions whether it is possible for the US to save taxpayer dollars in mitigating the effects of these catastrophes. 
We find similar trends between global CO2 emissions, the count of natural disasters in the US, people affected by natural disasters in the US, and money spent on 
natural disaster relief by the US. Together, these trends indicate the possibility to improve US citizens’ lives and save the US government billions of dollars by 
working together with countries worldwide to reduce the CO2 emissions.



# Conclusions drawn:
Climate change has many effects on our planet. This research focuses on climate change’s effect on the  human and monetary costs of natural disasters. Studies have shown that human-induced climate change is in large part due to CO2 emissions across the globe. Our analysis starts by showing the increasing global  trend in CO2 emissions. An increasing trend can also be seen for the counts of natural disasters, the number of people affected by natural disasters, and the cost of natural disasters across the United States. As such, it is possible that climate change causes these increasing trends of human and financial costs to the US. If countries around the world worked together to decrease human-induced climate change, our analysis shows it is possible to save and improve people’s lives and save the US government billions of dollars. 
In the future, we will need more information to establish a causal relationship between climate change and these increasing trends. There are three areas to focus efforts on. Further analysis of how people are affected by disasters is necessary. More detail is needed on how US dollars have been used for disaster events over time. Finally, consideration is needed of how data collection might have changed over time due to improved technologies on detecting natural disasters, obtaining numbers of people affected from disasters, and dollar values of relief efforts.
