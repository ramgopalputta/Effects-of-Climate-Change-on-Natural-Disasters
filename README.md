# Effects_of_Climate_Change_on_Natural_Disasters

#Abstract of the project: 

Climate change has created a series of adverse effects on our planet. Is it causing an effect on the frequency and severity of natural disasters across the globe? 
If so, can governments save human lives and money by reducing climate change causes? Our carbon footprint harms the environment we live in as it is one of the main 
causes of human-induced climate change. As of October 11, 2022, there have been 15 weather/climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each to affect 
the United States (Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters, 2022). This study investigates the impact of CO2 emissions on the frequency and severity of natural 
disasters and questions whether it is possible for the US to save taxpayer dollars in mitigating the effects of these catastrophes. 
We find similar trends between global CO2 emissions, the count of natural disasters in the US, people affected by natural disasters in the US, and money spent on 
natural disaster relief by the US. Together, these trends indicate the possibility to improve US citizensâ€™ lives and save the US government billions of dollars by 
working together with countries worldwide to reduce the CO2 emissions.
